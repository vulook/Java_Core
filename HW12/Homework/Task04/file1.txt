My name is Andriy Vulook and I was born on the 29th of April, 1980 in Rivne City, Ukraine. Ukraine is my motherland and I am proud that I am Ukrainian. I was born in Ukraine, I grow up and I study here. I love its picturesque views - fields, rivers, forests and mountains. I’ve been working as an administrative assistant for three years. At my current job in the finance department of a midsize company, I handle scheduling, meeting and travel planning for four executives and 20 staff members. I also help prepare correspondence, presentations and reports. I’m known for being a detail-oriented, well-organized team player. I never miss deadlines, I’m a good communicator and I can juggle multiple tasks at once. In my performance reviews, my supervisor always notes that he appreciates my professionalism and enthusiasm for the job. With this experience under my belt, I’m looking for an opportunity to take the next step in my career. I’m hoping to do so in an organization like yours that works in IT, which is something I’m passionate about.
